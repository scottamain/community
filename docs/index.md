title: OpenXLA project
subtitle: |
  An open ecosystem of portable and extensible ML infrastructure
  projects that simplify ML development by defragmenting the tools
  between frontend frameworks and hardware backends. Built by industry leaders
  in ML software and hardware.

## StableHLO

A versioned operator set for ML computations that provides data portability
between ML frameworks and compilers.

+ <span class="material-icon">history</span>
  **Backward-compatible versions**

+ <span class="material-icon">description</span>
  **Serializable format**

## XLA Compiler

An ML compiler that optimizes models for high-performance execution
across hardware platforms including GPUs, CPUs, and ML accelerators.

+ <span class="material-icon">terminal</span>
  **Build anywhere**
  Build and compile your models optimally across leading ML frameworks
  such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX.

+ <span class="material-icon">speed</span>
  **Scale your performance**
  Maximize and scale performance through a wide range of production-tested
  optimization passes and automated partitioning for model parallelism.

+ <span class="material-icon">developer_board</span>
  **Run anywhere**
  Run your models anywhere with support for all leading ML backends
  including GPUs, CPUs, and ML accelerators.

+ <span class="material-icon">home_repair_service</span>
  **Simplify your tools**
  Eliminate the complexity of managing diverse domain-specific compilers.
  OpenXLA leverages the power of MLIR to bring the best capabilities into
  a single compiler toolchain.
